# multiclass-classifier-pytorch-nn
Pytorch feed forward neural network for multi-class classification of music data that has representations of the varying intensities of different instrument within a song to help represent it's genre. The instrument intensities in the training dataset are represented as an array of float32 for each sample. The same is expected by the model for prediction of the genre
